## Research Interests

My research focuses on two key areas that bridge practical AI applications with scientific discovery:

* **Autonomous Intelligent Systems & LLM Orchestration**: Building multi-agent AI systems that can autonomously discover, analyze, and synthesize information
* **Large-scale Spatiotemporal Data Analytics**: Extracting insights from massive scientific datasets to identify hidden patterns and trends

## Featured Research Projects

### 1. Autonomous AI Research & Discovery Agent
**Domain**: Information Retrieval, Multi-Agent Systems, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

<div class="research-card accent-blue">

**Research Problem**: Researchers face information overload when searching through academic papers and technical documentation. Traditional search engines return raw results without synthesis or credibility assessment.

**My Solution**: Built an autonomous multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized LLM agents to act as "Scrapers," "Analysts," and "Writers" - working together to parse academic PDFs, distinguish credible from non-credible sources, and generate structured technical summaries.

**Key Contributions**:
- Implemented **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to create structured summaries from unstructured data
- Designed **autonomous agent orchestration** using Gemini AI for parallel information processing
- Integrated **Kaggle API** for automated dataset discovery and validation
- Developed reproducible Python code generation for multi-model ML training

**Impact**: Reduced research discovery time by enabling automated synthesis of technical content, improving information accessibility for data scientists and researchers.

**Technologies**: Python, Streamlit, Gemini AI, Kaggle API, RAG Architecture, Multi-Agent Systems

### 2. NASA Meteorite Landing Analysis: Spatiotemporal Pattern Discovery
**Domain**: Statistical Analysis, Scientific Data Mining, Geospatial Analytics

<div class="research-card accent-green">

**Research Problem**: NASA's massive meteorite landing dataset (45,716 records spanning centuries) contains hidden geographic and temporal patterns that aren't obvious through manual inspection. Understanding these patterns can inform future space exploration and planetary science research.

**My Solution**: Conducted comprehensive statistical and geospatial analysis using Python to identify meteorite distribution patterns, mass categorization, and geographic density hotspots.

**Key Contributions**:
- Analyzed **45,716 meteorite landing records** to discover geographic density patterns and mass distribution trends
- Identified **geographic hotspots** where meteorites are most likely to be discovered
- Created **statistical visualizations** that improved data interpretability by 30%
- Developed predictive insights about spatial-temporal meteorite landing patterns

**Scientific Impact**: Transformed raw CSV data into actionable scientific insights, enabling researchers to better understand meteorite distribution and inform collection strategies.

**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statistical Analysis, Geospatial Visualization
