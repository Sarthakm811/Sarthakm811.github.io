### Project Overview
This project focuses on performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Adidas US Sales dataset to identify high-growth regions, top-performing retailers, and the most profitable sales methods.



### Technical Workflow:
* **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned and structured an extensive Excel dataset (~9,600 rows) using **Pandas**, including handling missing values, re-indexing, and data type verification.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leveraged **NumPy** and Pandas to segment sales data by retailer, product category, and geographic region.
* **Statistical Visualization:** Created a suite of visual analytics using **Matplotlib** to communicate complex trends, such as the 30% revenue dominance of online sales channels.
* **Business Intelligence:** Identified **Foot Locker** as the leading retailer and determined that the **West and Northeast** regions serve as the primary drivers of total revenue.

### Key Insights:
* **Channel Performance:** Online sales consistently outperform in-store and outlet methods in terms of total revenue contribution.
* **Product Demand:** Footwear emerged as the highest revenue-generating category across all US regions.
* **Optimization:** Discovered significant variance in profit margins across product lines, suggesting areas for inventory optimization.

### Tech Stack:
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
